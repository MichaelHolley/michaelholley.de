# Portfolio page for Michael Holley

Overall, my intention was to build a portfolio website that showcased my skills and expertise as a developer, while also creating a great user experience and promoting my personal brand. By using the latest web development technologies and creating visually appealing and interactive elements, I hoped to make a strong impression on potential clients and employers.
